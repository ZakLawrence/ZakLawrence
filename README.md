## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher on the [CMS](https://cms.cern) experiment at [CERN](https://home.cern)! I'm based at [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en) in Belgium, where I work a memeber of [CP3](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/public/member/814/en) on measurements targeting the interaction between the top quark and Higgs boson.  

## :briefcase: Profesional History
Perviously I worked as a PhD student at the University of Manchester doing research into the CP properties of the top-Higgs coupling using data collected by the ATLAS experiment. Within this role I worked as one of the lead analysers of the first measurement performed at the LHC of the CP properties in the channel where the Higgs decays to a pair of bottom quarks.
